# Basic Application Upgrades

So far we learned how to effectively create a scalable application that our end users can access. If we are developing our own applications, we will likely have to upgrade our replicas to a newer version though. This has always been the case, but the frequency of new application upgrades has been increasing over the last few years through microservices and similar techniques. Containers are a perfect vehicle for such applications, and we can thus expect application upgrades to happen relatively frequently.
